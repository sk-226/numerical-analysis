# Tips for Using a Package

- Start the package folder’s name with a “+” (e.g., +mypackage).
- Verify that you have added it to the path with `addpath('path/to/project')` or `addpath('path/to/package')`. (Recommended to add the path to the project folder.)
- Don’t forget to import it with `import package.*`.
- Make the function name match the file name, and follow the one-function-per-file rule.
